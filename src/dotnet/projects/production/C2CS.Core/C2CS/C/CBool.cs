/// <summary>
///     A boolean value type with the same memory layout as a <see cref="byte" /> in both managed and unmanaged
///     contexts; equivalent to a standard bool (_Bool) found in C/C++/ObjC where <c>0</c> is <c>false</c> and <c>1</c> is
///     <c>true</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///     <para>
///         In the world of .NET, data is often represented in memory differently depending on the context of being
///         managed (.NET) and unmanaged (C/C++/ObjC). Blittable types are data types which have the same bit
///         representation in both managed and unmanaged contexts. The <see cref="bool" /> found in .NET is not
///         blittable (!). If data types have the same bit representation between contexts they can be "blitted"
///         (block bit transfer) between the contexts with minimal to zero overhead. Understanding the difference
///         between blittable and non-blittable types help in having correct and highly performant interoperability between
///         managed (.NET) applications/libraries and unmanaged (C/C++/ObjC) applications/libraries.

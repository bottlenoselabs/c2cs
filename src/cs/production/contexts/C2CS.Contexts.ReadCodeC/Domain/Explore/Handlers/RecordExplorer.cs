        //  Case 2: If the union has no tag (identifier) and has a member name (field name), it should be included as a normal field.
        //  Case 3: If the union has a tag (identifier) and has no member name (field name), it should not be included at all as a field. (Dangling union.)

        // The problem is that C allows unions or structs to be declared inside the body of the union or struct.
        // This makes matching type identifiers to field names slightly difficult as Clang reports back the fields, unions, and structs for a given struct or union.
        // However, the unions and structs reported are always before the field for the matching union or struct, if there is one.
        // Thus, the solution here is to filter out the unions or structs that match to a field, leaving behind the anonymous structs or unions that need to get promoted.
        //  I.e. return only cursors which are fields, except for case 1.

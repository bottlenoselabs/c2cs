## Installing `C2CS`

`C2CS` is distributed as a NuGet tool. To get started all you need is the .NET software development kit to access `dotnet tool`.

### Latest release

```bash
dotnet tool install bottlenoselabs.c2cs --global 
```

### Latest pre-release

```bash
dotnet tool install bottlenoselabs.c2cs --global --add-source https://www.myget.org/F/bottlenoselabs/api/v3/index.json --version "*-*"
```

- ðŸ’¡ For a specific pre-release, including a specific pull-request or the latest Git commit of the `main` branch, see: https://www.myget.org/feed/bottlenoselabs/package/nuget/bottlenoselabs.C2CS.
- ðŸ’¡ If you see a specific version but the `dotnet tool` command doesn't see it, try clearing your NuGet caches:
```bash
dotnet nuget locals all --clear
```

## How to use `C2CS`

To generate bindings for a C library you need to use a configuration `.json` file which specifies the input to C2CS. See the next sub-section below for documention on each property. See the [Hello World `config.json` file](src/cs/examples/helloworld/helloworld-c/config.json) for an example with annotated comments.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json",
  "directory": "path/to/my_c_library/ast",
  "ast": {
    "input_file": "path/to/my_c_library/include/my_c_library.h"
  },
  "cs": {
    "output_file": "path/to/my_c_library/cs/my_c_library.cs"
  }
}
```

By default running `c2cs` via terminal will search for a `config.json` file in the current directory. If you want to use a specific `.json` file, specify the file path as the first argument: `c2cs -c myConfig.json`.

### Configuration `.json` properties

The configuration properties are documented in the schema file: https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json. By adding the schema to your JSON file, as seen in the example above, you can get intellisense in Visual Studio Code or your text editor of choice.

## Cross-parsing with `C2CS`

What if you want to generate bindings for each platform in one `.cs` file? Cross-parsing is the way to do that.

Let's take a look at a more complicated example by adding multiple target platforms to generate C# bindings for. (Omitting this information generates C# bindings using the host platform as the target.) Each target platform is a [Clang "target triple"](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/CrossCompilation.html) in the form of `arch-vendor-os[-environment]`. This is basically "cross-parsing" (as opposed to cross-compilation) of the C header `.h` file.

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json",
  "directory": "path/to/my_c_library/ast",
  "ast": {
    "input_file": "path/to/my_c_library/include/my_c_library.h",
    "platforms": {
      "aarch64-pc-windows-msvc": {},
      "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": {},
      "aarch64-apple-darwin": {},
      "x86_64-apple-darwin": {},
      "aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu": {},
      "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": {}
    }
  },
  "cs": {
    "output_file": "path/to/my_c_library/cs/my_c_library.cs"
  }
}
```

The only problem with this approach is that sometimes a Clang "target triple" may not not be available or work correctly with your version of Clang that is installed for your host operating system.
- macOS Apple Sillicon `aarch64-apple-darwin` may not be understood in your version of Clang that is installed.
- I found a bug where "cross-parsing" from Ubuntu 20.04 as the host `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` to Windows `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` results in wrong type size information.
  
Thus, what I recommend is that different configuration files are used for each host to parse the C header `.h` file. Then use `c2cs ast -c config_ast_x.json` to generate the ASTs (abstract syntax trees) for each Clang target triple.

`config_ast_windows.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json",
  "directory": "path/to/my_c_library/ast",
  "ast": {
    "input_file": "path/to/my_c_library/include/my_c_library.h",
    "platforms": {
      "aarch64-pc-windows-msvc": {},
      "x86_64-pc-windows-msvc": {}
    }
  }
}
```

`config_ast_macos.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json",
  "directory": "path/to/my_c_library/ast",
  "ast": {
    "input_file": "path/to/my_c_library/include/my_c_library.h",
    "platforms": {
      "aarch64-apple-darwin": {},
      "x86_64-apple-darwin": {},
      "aarch64-apple-ios": {}
    }
  }
}
```

`config_ast_linux.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json",
  "directory": "path/to/my_c_library/ast",
  "ast": {
    "input_file": "path/to/my_c_library/include/my_c_library.h",
    "platforms": {
      "aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu": {},
      "x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu": {},
      "aarch64-linux-android": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Once the AST files are generated, move them all over to any operating system and generate the C# bindings for all of them at once using `c2cs cs -c config_cs.json`.

`config_cs.json`
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://github.com/bottlenoselabs/c2cs/schema.json",
  "directory": "path/to/my_c_library/ast",
  "cs": {
    "output_file": "path/to/my_c_library/cs/my_c_library.cs"
  }
}
```

## How to use `C2CS.Runtime`

The `C2CS.Runtime` C# code is directly added to the bottom of the generated bindings in a class named `Runtime` with a C# region named `C2CS.Runtime`. The `Runtime` static class contains helper structs, methods, and other kind of "glue" that make interoperability with C in C# easier and more idiomatic.

### Custom C# project properties for `C2CS.Runtime`

#### `SIZEOF_WCHAR_T`:

The following only applies and is of interest to you if you are using `wchar_t` directly in the public C header. Note that `wchar_t*` does not apply, it has to be directly using `wchar_t`. 

Use a value of `1`, `2`, or `4` to specify the backing byte field size of `CCharWide`. `CCharWide` in C# is intended to be blittable to `wchar_t` in C. There is no default value set for `SIZEOF_WCHAR_T` but the default size of `CCharWide` is 2. This is incorrect on some platforms like Linux.

To set it:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <SIZEOF_WCHAR_T>2</SIZEOF_WCHAR_T>
</PropertyGroup>
```  

## Building `C2CS` from source

      1. Install Git Bash. (Usually installed with Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/downloads.)
      2. Install MSCV (Microsoft Visual C++) Build Tools + some C/C++ SDK for Windows. (You can use Visual Studio Installer application to install the C/C++ workload or the components individually. You can also install it all via web or appropriate command line.)
    - macOS:
      1. Install XCode CommandLineTools (gcc, clang, etc): ```xcode-select --install```
      2. Install XCode through the App Store (necessary for SDKs).
      3. Install Brew if you have not already: https://brew.sh
      4. Install CMake: ```brew install cmake```
    - Linux:
      1. Install the software build tools for your distro including GCC, Clang, and CMake.
3. Clone the repository with submodules: `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lithiumtoast/c2cs.git`.

### Visual Studio / Rider / MonoDevelop

Open `./C2CS.sln`

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

`dotnet build`

## Debugging `C2CS` from source

### Debugging using logging

Structured logging is added for sanity checking of normal/expected operation. It is also extremely helpful for diagnosing or digging into a problem. In more advanced situations it is used for automated black box testing. Any log can easily be identifiable back to the code via a quick search.

An example of some logging output for console:

Things to notice from left to right:

- Date
- Time
- Log level:
    -  `trce` stands for "trace". Ignorable at a glance; used for verbose information about what the program is doing exactly.
    -  `info`. Used for general higher level information about what the program is doing. Good for building automation tests from logging.
    -  `warn` stands for "warning". Suspicious; indicative of an expected but undesired outcome. Does not halt the program.
    -  `error`. Unacceptable; indicative of an unexpected result which should get fixed. Does not halt the program.
    -  `crit`. Crash; gracefully exit the program with a stack trace.
- `[number]`: Used for automated tests and otherwise quick searching. Each kind of log is easily identifiable by a unique numeric identifier. E.g., when any use case begins it is 2. When any use case end successfully it is 3.
- `=>`: The scope of the log. Helps keep track of the context of the log. Scopes can be nested with more than one `=>`. E.g. there is a scope for the use case of "Extract AST C" and a scope for "Extract x86_64-pc-windows". `x86_64-pc-windows` is the target platform to parse the C code with Clang.

## Examples

Here you will find examples of C libraries being demonstrated with `C2CS` as smoke tests or otherwise used directly.

### Hello world

Hello world example of callings C functions from C#. This is meant to be minimalistic to demonstrate the minimum required things to get this working.

1. Run the C# project [`helloworld-c`](/src/cs/examples/helloworld/helloworld-c/Program.cs). This builds the example shared library and generate the bindings for the [`my_c_library`](/src/cs/examples/helloworld/helloworld-c/my_c_library) C project. The C# bindings will be written to [`my_c_library.cs`](/src/cs/examples/helloworld/helloworld-cs/my_c_library.cs).
2. Run the C# project [`helloworld-cs`](/src/cs/examples/helloworld/helloworld-cs/Program.cs). You should see output to the console of C functions being called from C#.

### [libclang](./001_LIBCLANG.md)

`C2CS` uses bindings generated for libclang using `C2CS`. In this sense, the `C2CS` project eats it's own dogfood.

Run the C# project [`clang-c`](/src/dotnet/prod/libclang-c/Program.cs) to build the shared library and generate the bindings. This project is not like other examples because the generated bindings are used as part of C2CS in the next build. This means that C2CS generates bindings for libclang which then can generate bindings for libclang.

If you just want to see the bindings, you can take a look at [`libclang.cs`](/src/dotnet/prod/libclang-cs/libclang.cs).
